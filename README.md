# PForf
An interpreter for a Forth-like stack based language. The interpreter is contained entirely in one file and doesn't have any dependencies.

## Usage
Invoke pforf.py using a Python interpreter, followed by the filename like so. The repository comes with a sample program for 99 beers on the wall, so you can cd into the project directory and invoke:<br />
python pforf.py beers.pf
